# Yuki - AI Bot with VTuber Model and Game Integration

Yuki is an AI bot currently under development with the goal of integrating a VTuber model, game-playing capabilities, and access to a variety of APIs. The model is still being trained, but it will eventually be able to interact with users, participate in games, and access various online services.

## Features (Planned)

- [ ] **VTuber Model**: Yuki will have a VTuber avatar, enabling engaging and dynamic interactions with users.
- [ ] **Game Integration**: Yuki will be able to play games, providing an interactive experience.
- [ ] **API Access**: Yuki will be able to access and interact with a range of APIs for different tasks and services.
- [x] **Speech Recognition**: Yuki will be able to understand voice commands and interact accordingly.
- [ ] **Machine Learning Integration**: Yuki will continuously improve its responses and performance through machine learning techniques.
- [ ] **User Interaction**: Yuki will be able to have casual conversations and interact with users naturally.
- [ ] **Content Creation**: Yuki will be capable of assisting with content creation for social media and other platforms.

### Requirements

To run Yuki with the 700B model of LLaMA, you will need the following:

#### Hardware Requirements:
- **GPU**: At least one high-performance GPU with substantial VRAM (e.g., Nvidia A100, V100, or similar). Recommended 40GB or more VRAM for optimal performance.
- **CPU**: High-performance multi-core processor (e.g., AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, Intel Core i9-12900K or higher).
- **RAM**: Minimum 128GB of system memory. For large models, 256GB or more is recommended.
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 1TB of free space. NVMe SSD is recommended for faster data throughput.

#### Software Requirements:
- **Operating System**: Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu or CentOS recommended). Alternatively, Windows with WSL 2.
- **CUDA**: CUDA 11.4 or higher with cuDNN support. Ensure your GPU drivers are up-to-date.
- **Python**: Python 3.9 or later (Python 3.10+ recommended).
- **Dependencies**: Use the `requirements.txt` file for the necessary Python dependencies.
